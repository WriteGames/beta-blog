We are delighted to present WriteGames.com to the world: a collection of articles, interviews, and tutorials to help game developers of all levels learn how to make the games they want to make.

We previously ran [indie(Function);](https://indiefunction.com) from 2011-2021, where we interviewed over a hundred indie game developers across a podcast, blog, and e-magazine. In building that network, we've come into a great privilege of having so many accomplished developers, along with their knowledge, at our fingertips. What if we could share that knowledge, that privilege, with everyone?

That's the idea behind this site! By digging into the minds of some of the most skilled among us, we aim to become one of the best resources online for learning game development.
