CALM
GREAT VISUAZATIONS
FANTASTIC EXPLANATIONS (simplifies things)

One of my favorite game developers to watch on YouTube is [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague). The Danish game dev documents his coding explorations, which have covered how to create portals, implement boids, leverage ray tracing, and many more fascinating deep dives into complex subjects.

His latest video, the first since late 2023, clocks in at an hour and ten minutes. I was anticipating on watching it in two chunks, but ended up being mesmerized by the rollercoaster of victories and rendering bugs.

Includes: bezier curves, intersections, sign distance functions, floating point imprecision

"I am always in utter awe at your ability to calmly (at least it's how you present it) tackle any topic in programming, without frustrations and abandonment. You are an inspiration for all of us aspiring programmers"
