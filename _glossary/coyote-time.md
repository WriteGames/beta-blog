summary: Allow jumping for a short window after falling off a ledge
---

A brief window after falling off a ledge where the player can still jump. In some cases, the player may also be able to walk back onto the ledge (see: [corner correction](corner-correction)).

## What It Solves

During difficult platforming sections, players can benefit from having more generous time windows, both from "coyote time" and [input buffering](input-buffering), to ensure being a frame or two off doesn't cost them a life.
